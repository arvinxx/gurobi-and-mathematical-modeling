# Gurobi modeling examples

## Introduction: 

### Target audience:
Data scientists, engineers, computer scientists, economists, and in general, professionals with background on mathematical modeling and basic knowledge of Python.

### Goals of modeling examples:
+ Illustrate  broad applicability of mathematical optimization.
+ Show how to build mathematical optimization models.

Modeling examples are coded using the Gurobi Python API in Jupyter Notebook.

The modeling examples illustrate important features of the Gurobi Python API modeling objects such as adding decision 
variables, building linear expressions, adding constraints, and adding an objective function for a mathematical optimization 
model. In addition, they explain more advanced features such as generalized constraints, piece-wise linear functions, 
multi-objective hierarchical optimization, as well as “typical” type of constraints such as “allocation constraints”, 
“balance constraints”, “sequencing constraints”, “precedence constraints”, etc. In addition, these modeling examples 
show how the modeling objects of Gurobi and the typical type of constraints can be used in different contexts.
