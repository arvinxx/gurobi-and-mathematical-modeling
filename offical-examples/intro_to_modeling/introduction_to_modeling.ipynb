    "\n",
    "Consider a consulting company that has three open positions: Tester, Java Developer, and Architect. The three top candidates (resources) for the positions are: Carlos, Joe, and Monika. The consulting company administered competency tests to each candidate in order to assess their ability to perform each of the jobs. The results of these tests are called *matching scores*. Assume that only one candidate can be assigned to a job, and at most one job can be assigned to a candidate.\n",

The Gurobi Optimizer solves the mathematical optimization problem using state-of-the-art mathematics and computer science.\n",
