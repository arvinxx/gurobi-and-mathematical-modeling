    "This model is an example of an electrical power generation problem (also known as a unit commitment problem). It selects an optimal set of power stations to turn on in order to satisfy anticipated power demand over a 24-hour time horizon.  It is an extension of an earlier 'Electrical Power Generation' example (example 15 from HP Williams); the extension adds the option of using hydroelectric power plants to satisfy demand.\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, thermal power generation units are grouped into three distinct types, with different characteristics for each type (power output, cost per megawatt hour, startup cost, etc.).  A unit can be on or off, with a startup cost associated with transitioning from off to on, and power output that can fall anywhere between a specified minimum and maximum value when the unit is on.  There are also two hydroelectric plants available, also with different cost and power generation characteristics.  A 24-hour time horizon is divided into 5 discrete time periods, each with an expected total power demand.  The model decides which units to turn on, and when, in order to satisfy demand for each time period.  The model also captures a reserve requirement, where the selected power plants must be capable of increasing their output, while still respecting their maximum output, in order to cope with the situation where actual demand exceeds predicted demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of generators is available to satisfy power demand for the following day.  Anticipated demand is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Time Period | Demand (megawatts) |\n",

    "| 2 | 5 | 1500 | 4000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are costs associated with using a thermal generator: a cost per hour when the generator is on (and generating its minimum output), a cost per megawatt hour above its minimum, and a startup cost for turning a generator on:\n",

    "| B | 1400 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The costs associated with using a hydro plant are slightly different.  There's an hourly cost, but it is much smaller than the hourly cost of a thermal generator.  The real cost for a hydroelectric plant comes from depletion of the water in the reservoir, which happens at different rates for the two units.  The reservoir must be replenished before the end of the time horizon by pumping water into it, which consumes electricity.  A hydroelectric plant also has a startup cost.\n",

    "Pumping water into the reservoir consumes electricity at a rate of 3000 MWh of electricity per meter of height.  The height of the reservoir at the end of the time horizon must be equal to the height at the beginning.\n",

    "Generators must meet predicted demand, but they must also have sufficient reserve capacity to be able to cope with the situation where actual demand exceeds predicted demand.
